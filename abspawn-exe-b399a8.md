ABSpawn.exe is an executable file associated with AOMEI Backupper, a backup and recovery software developed by AOMEI Technology, specifically in version 5.3. This file is generally considered safe as it is part of the legitimate software package used to facilitate backup operations, and it typically runs in the background to manage tasks related to the application. However, like any executable, it may trigger false positives in some antivirus programs due to its nature. Users may occasionally encounter errors related to ABSpawn.exe, such as issues with the software not launching properly or problems during backup processes, but these are usually resolvable through updates or adjustments in settings. It's important to ensure that the software is downloaded from the official AOMEI website to avoid potential risks of malware disguised as ABSpawn.exe.
